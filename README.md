# X-Files Trivia Game

## Motivation
To demonstrate my knowledge of jQuery. 
I chose X-Files because, well...X-Files.
## What is this?
X-Files Trivia Game is a timed ten question trivia game that uses JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate the HTML with click events. 
## How does it work?
The player clicks on the start button at the landing page and is immediately taken to the first question.

There are a total of ten questions.

The player has ten seconds to answer each question or it is counted as incorrect.

There is a three second delay after each  question is answered to ready the player for the next question, and of course to enjoy the awesome gifs provided by  [Giphy](https://github.com/Giphy).

After all ten questions have been answered the player is given their score with an option to re-play by clicking on a button.

## Technologies Used

1. HTML
2. Vanilla CSS
3. JavaScript
4. jQuery
